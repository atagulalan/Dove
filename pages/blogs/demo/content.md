**Example Bold Text** is running through your weins.

And **_this is very important_**.

Or... _Are they really?_

One line after
another?

There will be [A Link] here,

There will be [An External Link] here,

(External links will open in new tab and focus to that tab)

And some `INLINE_CODE` here? And some more `INLINE_CODE` here? And some more `INLINE_CODE` here? And some more `INLINE_CODE` here?
```JavaScript
andSome = () => {
  actualCode("here");
}
```
Maybe a little table?

| First Header  | Second Header |

| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| :------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
  * Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
  1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.


- Item 1

Pythagoran theorem is $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
 
Bayes theorem:
 
$$
P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H)}{P(E)} P(H)
$$

More Complex LaTeX:

$$\begin{array}{c}

\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} &
= \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}}    \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} & = 4 \pi \rho \\

\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}\, +\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} & = \vec{\mathbf{0}} \\

\nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}} & = 0

\end{array}$$

Some Images:
![Big tag extends to full page width](%ASSETS%/og.png "big")
![Fill tag only extends edge of the text](%ASSETS%/og.png "fill")

![You cannot show tags on HTML unless it's big or fill](%ASSETS%/small.png)

Inline?: ![Because it would act like it's inline](%ASSETS%/mini.png)

(It also has webp fallback to png.)

You can import audio just like an image
